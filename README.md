# Computational Humanities Workshop Short Paper Submission

Repo for code and markdown submission for the [Computational Humanities Workshop (18-20 November 2020)](https://www.computational-humanities-research.org/cfp/)

This github repo contains the R markdown used to build the LaTeX file for the paper. The markdown file contains the code used to produce the various figures, but not currently the full underlying data - this is still a work in progress and the datasets will be released at a later stage. 'metrics' is derived from the full EMLO data set and was used to produce the table of overlaps, and 'dummy.csv' was a toy network used for the illustrative graph of the overlaps tool.

We are grateful to Matthew Peeples for permission to build on his suggested method for measuring network metric robustness. A complete version of the code used will be released alongside a longer-form paper.
