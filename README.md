# Computational Humanities Workshop Short Paper Submission

Repo for code and markdown submission for Computation Humanities Workshop (18-20 November 2020)

This github repo contains the R markdown used to build the LaTeX file for the paper. The markdown file contains the code used to produce the various figures, but not currently the underlying data - this is still a work in progress and the datasets will be released at a later stage.
